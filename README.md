Calculate the cost after carpooling with your friends

Format: ./exec_file \<miles\> \<mpg\> \<bridge_fee\> \<gas_price\> \<people\>

Where:
- \<miles\>: how far you/they have driven, in decimal
- \<mpg\>: the car's fuel efficiency value, in miles per gallon, in decimal
- \<bridge_fee\>: bridge's fee or toll paid, in decimal
- \<gas_price\>: current gas price, in decimal
- \<people\>: how many people were in the car, in integer

# Things I learned
Practice using C to solve a real world problem that I often faced: figuring the cost to send money to my friends after carpooling with them to/from school.
